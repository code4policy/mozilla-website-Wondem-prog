    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <img src="images/WondemPic.JPG" alt="My Photo" />
    <p>This is a sample HTML page.</p>
    <p>I am just experimenting on htms and css and trying to create my first page</p>
    <p>Creating a webpage has become a little more demanding for me principally because I had little familiarity with computer except word and pdf and also recently Excel. Most of them I knew them are very useful in my learning to code but they are often used differently, requiring to unlearn and learn also. A bit tricky but managing it still</p>
    <p>Now I can tell the structure of httml, from class presentation and discussion as well as my reading of Mozilla. Now I know body contains everything, almost. Now I knwo also my paragraphs should be ordered in ways I want them to appear in my website. Well writing in the subl appears ok but much better probably is writing them in word or other better tools having the editing and other functionalities</p>
    <p>My principal interst in coding is not to be a coder but as legal and policy advisor to understand what goes on behind developers designing websites, survey data, visualization, and so on, which I will extensively be using in my policy work</p>
    <p>I guess these few paragraphs would do just fine as starting point and let me quickly look at the remaining turorials and improve my website. For example my picture appearing in the website is huuuuuuuge</p>
